                    Anna Karenina provides a vast panorama of contemporary life in Russia and of humanity in general. In it Tolstoy 
                    uses his intense imaginative insight to create some of the most memorable characters in all of literature. Anna 
                    is a sophisticated woman who abandons her empty existence as the wife of Karenin and turns to Count Vronsky to 
                    fulfil her passionate nature - with tragic consequences. Levin is a reflection of Tolstoy himself, often expressing
                     the author's own views and convictions. <br>

                    The Divine Comedy describes Dante's descent into Hell with Virgil as a guide; his ascent of Mount Purgatory and 
                    encounter with his dead love, Beatrice; and finally, his arrival in Heaven. Examining questions of faith, desire 
                    and enlightenment, the poem is a brilliantly nuanced and moving allegory of human redemption. <br> <br> <br>

                        Under the influence of their charismatic classics professor, a group of clever, eccentric misfits at an 
                        elite New England college discover a way of thinking and living that is a world away from the humdrum existence 
                        of their contemporaries. But when they go beyond the boundaries of normal morality they slip gradually from
                         obsession to corruption and betrayal, and at last - inexorably - into evil. <br>

                        The Picture of Dorian Gray, moral fantasy novel by Irish writer Oscar Wilde, published in an early form in 
                        Lippincott’s Monthly Magazine in 1890. The novel, the only one written by Wilde, had six additional chapters
                         when it was released as a book in 1891. The work, an archetypal tale of a young man who purchases eternal 
                         youth at the expense of his soul, was a romantic exposition of Wilde’s own Aestheticism. <br>

                        The oldest extant works of Western literature, Homer’s the Iliad and the Odyssey are an important part of the 
                        Greek culture. The Iliad gives a detailed poetic description of the war of Troy and expounds the battle and 
                        the events during the weeks of quarrels between King Agamemnon and warrior Achilles. The Odyssey expounds 
                        Homer’s energetic vision of everyman’s journey through life. It recounts the tale of Ulysses’ 
                        ‘nostros’—journey back home, after the ten-year-long Trojan War and the fall of the city of Troy. <br>
