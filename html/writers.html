                        Sappho (c. 630 – c. 570 BC) was an Archaic Greek poet from the island of Lesbos. Sappho is known for her lyric 
                        poetry, written to be sung while accompanied by a lyre. In ancient times, Sappho was widely regarded as one of 
                        the greatest lyric poets and was given names such as the "Tenth Muse" and "The Poetess". Most of Sappho's 
                        poetry is now lost, and what is extant has mostly survived in fragmentary form; two notable exceptions are the 
                        "Ode to Aphrodite" and the Tithonus poem. <br>

                            Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) was an American writer, poet, editor, and literary 
                            critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the 
                            macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and of American 
                            literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. He is 
                            also generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with 
                            contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. <br>
