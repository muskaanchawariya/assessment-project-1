                       <b>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</b> (27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791), was a prolific and influential composer 
                       of the Classical period. He composed more than 
                       600 works, many of which are acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral 
                       music. He is considered among the greatest classical composers of all time, and his influence on Western music 
                       is profound. <br><br>
