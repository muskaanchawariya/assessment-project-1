                     <b>Oscar-Claude Monet</b> (14 November 1840 – 5 December 1926) was a French painter, a founder of French 
                     Impressionist painting and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing
                      one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to plein air landscape painting. The term <b>
                        "Impressionism"</b> is derived from the title of his painting Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), 
                        which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as 
                        an alternative to the<b> Salon de Paris</b>. <br>

                    <b>Vincent Willem van Gogh</b> (30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is among 
                    the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade, he created about 
                    2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. 
                    They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and 
                    dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. He was not 
                    commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness, depression and poverty. <br>

                        <b>Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn </b>(15 July 1606 – 4 October 1669) was a Dutch draughtsman, painter, and 
                        printmaker. An innovative and prolific master in three media, he is generally considered one of the greatest 
                        visual artists in the history of art and the most important in Dutch art history. Unlike most Dutch masters 
                        of the 17th century, Rembrandt's works depict a wide range of style and subject matter, from portraits and 
                        self-portraits to landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and historical scenes, and biblical and mythological 
                        themes as well as animal studies.<br>

                        <b>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci </b> (14/15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519), known as Leonardo da Vinci, was an Italian
                         polymath of the Renaissance whose areas of interest included invention, drawing, painting, sculpture, architecture, 
                         science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, paleontology, and 
                         cartography. He has been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture, and is widely 
                         considered one of the greatest painters of all time (despite perhaps only 15 of his paintings having survived).<br>

                       <b>Artemisia Lomi</b> or <b>Artemisia Gentileschi </b> (July 8, 1593 – c. 1656) was an Italian Baroque painter, 
                       now considered one of the most accomplished seventeenth-century artists working in the dramatic style of 
                       Caravaggio. In an era when women had few opportunities to pursue artistic training or work as professional artists, 
                       Artemisia was the first woman to become a member of the Accademia di Arte del Disegno in Florence and had an 
                       international clientele. <br> <br>

                      <b>Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni </b>(6 March 1475 – 18 February 1564), known best as simply 
                      Michelangelo, was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect and poet of the High Renaissance born in the Republic 
                      of Florence, who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art. His artistic versatility 
                      was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, 
                      along with his rival, the fellow Florentine, Leonardo da Vinci. Several scholars have described Michelangelo as 
                      the greatest artist of his age and even as the greatest artist of all time. <br>

                       <b> Sofonisba Anguissola</b> (c. 1532 – 16 November 1625), also known as Sophonisba Angussola or Sophonisba 
                       Anguisciola,[2][3] was an Italian Renaissance painter born in Cremona to a relatively poor noble family. She 
                       received a well-rounded education that included the fine arts, and her apprenticeship with local painters set a 
                       precedent for women to be accepted as students of art. As a young woman, Anguissola traveled to Rome where she was 
                       introduced to Michelangelo, who immediately recognized her talent, and to Milan, where she painted the Duke of Alba.
                       The Spanish queen, Elizabeth of Valois, was a keen amateur painter and in 1559 Anguissola was recruited to go to
                        Madrid as her tutor, with the rank of lady-in-waiting. She later became an official court painter to the king, 
                        Philip II, and adapted her style to the more formal requirements of official portraits for the Spanish court. <br>

                        <b>Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino</b>(March 28 or April 6, 1483 – April 6, 1520), known as Raphael, was an Italian painter
                         and architect of the High Renaissance. His work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of composition, and visual 
                         achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur. Together with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he forms 
                         the traditional trinity of great masters of that period. <br>
