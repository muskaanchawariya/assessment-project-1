                            Oscar Wilde is a married writer who has occasionally indulged his weakness for male suitors. After much 
                            toil, Wilde debuts a stage comedy in London, and a chat at the theater with Lord Alfred "Bosie" Douglas 
                            leads to a full-on romance. Wilde ends up in a legal dispute with Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of 
                            Queensberry and, given the anti-gay local laws, is sent to jail. Wilde's vast intellect helps him survive 
                            until he regains his freedom. <br>
